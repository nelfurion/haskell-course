-- 1. Express the comprehension [f x | x ï‚¬ xs, p x] using the functions map and filter.

mapWhere :: (a -> a) -> (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
mapWhere mf ff as = map mf (filter ff as)

-- 3. Implement your own version of maximum using one of the fold functions.

foldr2 :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr2 (f) b (x:xs)
  | null xs = f x b
  | otherwise = f x (foldr2 f b xs)

foldr2 :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr2 (f) b xs
  | null xs = b
  | length xs == 1 = f (head xs) b
  | otherwise = f (head xs) (foldr2 f b (tail xs))

Guards are just boolean expressions. They do not do 
pattern matching by default. The <- left arrow is a way to allow pattern
matching in guards.

mystery xs = foldr (++) [] (map sing xs)
 where
 sing x = [x]
Hint: Work through what it does for a simple list, e.g. [1,2,3]
-}
{- Answer: maps an array of xs to array of arrays of x. Then concatenates
them back to an array of xs -}
